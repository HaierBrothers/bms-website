                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h5>What is a cryptocurrency?   </h5>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency is basically a virtual exchange medium that uses a cryptography in 
                    order to secure its transactions and control the creation of the system units. 
                    Meaning, cryptocurrency simply represents money in the digital marketplace 
                    nothing else. It is based on an open-source software, cryptography and 
                    networking. It lets people or users avoid fees or the lowest fees as compared to 
                    what your banks are charging. The system takes part in the non-cash transactions
                     that is anonymous while guaranteeing a secure transactions.</p>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency is associated with internet using cryptography process converting 
                    legible information into an almost uncrack-able digital code, impossible to crack 
                    transfers and purchases. </p>
                    <p>In history, cryptography was born during the Second World War in order to secure 
                    communication. It only evolved in the new generation age, the ‘digital era’ with the
                     elements of computer science and mathematical theory to become a secure 
                    money online, information and communications. </p>
                    <p>For most people, cryptocurrency topic are difficult to understand, cryptocurrencies 
                    key management mechanics commonly confuses people in the community. 
                    With this, there are cases in which people who purchased cryptocurrencies in the 
                    market, but in the end left them in others as the holder, the worst scenario is that 
                    the balance will be lost to an insider theft or some hackers. Cryptocurrency is 
                    subject to pump and dump and this is normal, this is similar to the penny stocks. 
                    Because no one knows what scale will be adopted by the currencies, and there is 
                    uncertainty about how the community will maximize them, any cryptocurrencies are
                    volatile relative to the traditional fiat currencies.</p>
                    <h5>Why use cryptocurrency?</h5>
                    <p>Basically, cryptocurrencies are known for its extreme security and anonymity to 
                    the highest level. Transactions made by this system cannot be reversed nor 
                    faked and compared to what your local bank are doing in its client charging high 
                    transaction fees. In cryptocurrency the fees are to the lowest level, making it 
                    reliable than the conventional currency in the marketplace. Its decentralized 
                    nature means they can be available to everyone, in which banks can only be 
                    available to those they permitted to open accounts. Cryptocurrency is a new 
                    generation cash, the cryptocurrency marketplace known this that currency that 
                    could take off high value even overnight. But same works the other way around. 
                    People who invest on cryptocurrencies must be aware on its volatility in the 
                    market and the possible risk when buying it. The high level of anonymity of 
                    cryptocurrencies make experts think that they are associated with the illegal 
                    activities on the digital marketplace, this is more to say specifically on dark web. 
                    Users should take extra careful when choosing currencies to keep.</p>
                    <h5>How many cryptocurrencies exist in the web?</h5>
                    <p>There is no exact number of existing cryptocurrencies exist in the ecosystem, 
                    this is because the code of the cryptocurrency is an open source, this means 
                    that anyone has the chance to create their own version of cryptocurrency by just 
                    using the code. But as to this moment, the estimated cryptocurrencies in the 
                    marketplace is about more than 900, along with the data embedded on them, 
                    which can be seen on the list of registered coins.</p>
                    <h5>What was the first cryptocurrency?</h5>
                    <p>The first cryptocurrency that was recorded in the digital data was bitcoin, 
                    created in the late 2009 and still as of now the best cryptocurrency known in the 
                    marketplace. A creation of cryptocurrencies has started emerging in the past 
                    decade and now more than 1000 cryptocurrencies can be found on the internet.</p>
                    <h5>What is alternative currency?</h5>
                    <p>A cryptocurrency is an alternative way if you want to transact something besides 
                    from the use of international or national currency. This currency is created by 
                    individual, organization or corporation, it can also be created by national, local 
                    or even state governments, or they can simply arise naturally as people agreed 
                    to use them as their common currency in the marketplace.</p>

                    <h2>Businesses</h2>
                    <h5>Is it that difficult to obtain cryptocurrency coin?</h5>
                    <p>This depends on some factors. But in general, if the kind of 
                    cryptocurrency was just recently introduced in the marketplace, the 
                    computing power needed in order to mine the coin is obviously low 
                    compared to the highly established crypto currency in the market.</p>
                    <p>These are list wherein you can acquire cryptocurrency coin. <br />
                    • Accept payment for a certain goods and services offered in the 
                    market.<br />
                    • Purchasing specific coins on legitimate exchangers online. <br />
                    • By simply exchanging coins to someone you know or some that is 
                    near you. <br />
                    • Earning it by simply mining.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Developers</h2>
                    <h5>What is Cryptocurrency Mining? </h5>
                    <p>Mining any type of cryptocurrencies basically needs powerful 
                    hardware and the right software. The value of the currency highly 
                    depends on the units available in the marketplace, they are 
                    carefully monitored in a very accurate process. Mining 
                    cryptocurrency is the process of generating units in the 
                    cryptocurrency. </p>
                    <p>To understand better, let us assume a large economy with billions 
                    of dollars in banks altogether. Now, since this situation is not 
                    physically possible for them to store these currency notes in 
                    banks, so they store it in a digital format with central reserve bank. 
                    The reserve bank then maintains a digital record of what it was 
                    owed to bank but doesn’t keep the notes in physical form. 
                    So whenever it needs to push money into the system and short of 
                    its notes, they will be printed and issued.</p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the reserved bank has the capability to print 
                    as many notes, it does not do without a valid reason. This is 
                    because when more currency is printed, more money is circulated 
                    in the market, therefore this will not make people richer, this will 
                    only devalue the existing currency. The more the units in the 
                    market the more it is divided and it becomes less.</p>
                    <p>The situation is the same when it comes to cryptocurrency, the 
                    mining of cryptocurrency is monitored carefully to ensure the value 
                    of existing coins will not depreciate. </p>

                <div id="Getting started">
                    <h2>Getting started</h2>
                    <h5>What is cryptocurrency exchange and market?</h5>
                    <p>A cryptocurrency market and exchange are both service in web, 
                    allowing cryptoccurrency token holder to trade to other currency or 
                    conventional monetary to their system. According to record, there 
                    are more than 2000 cryptocurrency exchangers in the ecosystem, 
                    among the largest are Bitstamp, Cryptsy, and Coinbase.</p>
                    <h5>How is the cryptocurrency value determined?</h5>
                    <p>The value of cryptocurrencies are ranked in a value or unit times 
                    and the cost of exchange to buy equals the capitalization in the 
                    market. For instance 1 Steem coin is worth $1.50 on Poloniex this 
                    rate was in the previous month. But the price can move at any 
                    moment, the market capitalization is only an estimate of the overall 
                    value of the digital currency.</p>
                    <h5>What are the exciting reason for you to get involved with the digital 
                    currency?</h5>
                    <p>With the ability to immediately transfer cash in just a matter of 
                    seconds to anyone around the globe from its wallet without having 
                    any fees or at lowest rate. Digital currencies enables spending and 
                    receiving money 20 times easier compared to your traditional wire 
                    transfer, western union and Paypal.</p>
                    <p>The digital currencies are just like real cash, meaning this can be 
                    used to merchants that received this kind of currency that you are 
                    holding, some merchants prefer to receive cryptocurrencies. 
                    Because in in cryptocurrency ones the payment is send, there is no 
                    chances the sender can get it back compared to PayPal or Strip in 
                    which customer can perform chargeback in which merchants loose 
                    the funds.</p>
                    <p>There is a higher possibilities that in the near future, all transaction 
                    will be done in a user to user system with the help of 
                    cryptocurrencies.</p>
                    <h5>What will be the worst part about cryptocurrencies?</h5>
                    <p>Like any other reasons on the digital world, losing your password 
                    or make mistake in your transaction then you will lose your funds 
                    or the account itself forever with no chance of getting it back. 
                    Cryptocurrencies are extremely serious and there’s no second 
                    chance at all, so make sure to take extra careful to everything you 
                    do with your wallet. Once locked then it’s a good bye to your 
                    account. To make worse, your cryptocurrency wallet are easy to rob 
                    compared to a what bank has. For instance your wallet is open on a 
                    computer then anyone has access with it, your overall balance 
                    could be washed out without any trace.</p>
                    <p>Even Law enforcement at less than NSA level is not able to help 
                    out unless the thief itself is sloppy beyond belief because of its 
                    convenience of moving the funds to any cryptocurrency through 
                    anonymous transaction makes tracking nearly impossible to those 
                    individual that has no access to the real time worldwide electronic 
                    monitoring system which is no one is going to allow use in case of 
                    a stolen cryptocurrency.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="How it Works">
                    <h2>How it Works</h2>
                    <h5>Why should I get involved in cryptocurrency? </h5>
                    <p>Because most people believed that it is profitable. Anyone has the 
                    option to mine its coins or simply invest into them. The expanding 
                    ecosystem provide a multiple opportunities on the possibility of 
                    doubling or even more your current assets.</p>
                    <p>What was more convincing was that, cryptocurrency value are 
                    evaluated constantly and then re-evaluated as more people join 
                    the network. At beginning, cryptocurrency revolution was at 100$ 
                    initial investment that could brought hundreds or even thousand 
                    profits. Till date, this kind of opportunity is still available.</p>
                    <h5>What is a cryptocurrency wallet?</h5>
                    <p>This is all about storing a cryptocurrency, wallet concept can be 
                    daunting a bit for the uninitiated. Basically, there are wallet 
                    software (this can be desktop, online or mobile), hardware based 
                    wallets, and of course the paper wallets. Talking about the “best” 
                    wallet in the ecosystem will be different for each one of us, it 
                    depends on a particular needs.</p>
                    <p>Wallets don’t just store cryptocurrency directly. It is accurate to 
                    think wallet as storing private keys. The Public key cryptography 
                    allows cryptocurrency to function, and uses a specific algorithms 
                    in order to generate pairs of keys. Public key is the address to 
                    which anyone can send its cryptocurrency balance. The private key 
                    allows owners spend funds from the specified address. Without the 
                    private key, public address becomes bottomless pit that you can 
                    only see; money still be sent there, but lost without a private key.</p>
                    <p>The type of wallets simply represents various ways a certain can 
                    secure their secret private key. There are two main types of 
                    cryptocurrency wallet, the hot and cold, these refers to the level or 
                    internet connectivity of the wallet. Paper wallet and hardware 
                    wallets are not actively connected to internet and considered as 
                    cold storage. Hot wallet is internet connected wallet, easy to 
                    spend, but vulnerable to cyber-attacks. A cold storage protects you 
                    from cyber-crime, but still it will be the owner’s responsibility to 
                    secure their property.

                    <h5>Which cryptocurrency is the best to date?</h5>
                    <p>The best cryptocurrency to purchase is the one that you want to 
                    hold on, whether the value goes down and goes up. I believe 
                    Bitcoin is the type of crypto that I am willing to hold even it totally 
                    goes down and will buy more eventually when the price goes really 
                    down. I don’t have any intention to sell these tokens and continue 
                    to invest in the long term because I believed that there are 
                    community behind it. One more thing focus on the established one. 
                    And only invest to what you can afford to lose.</p>
                    <h5>When is the right time to sell a cryptocurrency?</h5>
                    <p>The best time to sell a cryptocurrency is when you get 25% 
                    increase from the original purchase of your token. If it goes down, 
                    the option is to hold and wait till it gets back to higher price. 
                    As mentioned cryptocurrency are extremely volatile, you can lose 
                    95 percent of your asset anytime or earn 95 percent.</p>
                    <h5>When is the best time to invest in cryptocurrency? </h5>
                    <p>When is the right time to invest? The best strategy that most 
                    successful people did was consistently investing over time, this 
                    strategy minimizes the strong impact of volatile prices. 
                    For instance, you want to invest on Monero, but don’t have the 
                    idea if this currency is going to go down in the next days, buying 
                    every week instead of buying them at once is the ideal way 
                    because you will have a track of the changes in the marketplace, 
                    and with the strategy you will get a higher chances of getting a 
                    good deal. In short, investing in time is ideal, because this helps 
                    you adjust on the ups and downs of the prices effectively.</p>

                    <h5>Is Cryptocurrency Legal?</h5>
                    <p>It is very much understandable to have this question regarding its 
                    legality, e.g. using Bitcoin or BTC. This platform introduced a new 
                    paradigm which is away from traditional regulations and regulators 
                    that is govern by the fiat currency. </p>
                    <p>Not like counterfeit money, illegal, which is blatant example of 
                    “currency” that slants as legal, tender. But BTC is totally different. 
                    It operates in an ostensibly gray area when talking about 
                    regulation. But all of these issues boil down due to lack of rules 
                    that governs a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. rather 
                    than the blatant law violation.</p>
                    <p>All the questions regarding cryptocurrencies and the law depends 
                    on how these digital currency in the ecosystem are being utilized 
                    in the marketplace.</p>
                    <p>For instance, Bitcoin regulators have been concerned with its 
                    semi-anonymity and its decentralized nature in the digital 
                    marketplace. Not just in United States but the same situation 
                    towards other countries, authorities fear that the system could be 
                    used or already been used for such money laundering activities 
                    and purchase of these forbidden goods without having traced.</p>
                    <p>These activity are not helping out Bitcoin’s reputation with 
                    establishments that was prevalence of using it as major payment 
                    services in the digital marketplace, in which customers purchase 
                    illegal goods. Whether people uses Bitcoin or not as long as you 
                    are doing illegal activities it’s always be illegal. The issue here is 
                    the illegality of the activity, whether you paid something in cash, 
                    gold, Bitcoin, or any other forms of currency.</p>
                    <p>According to U.S. Treasury department Network. As 2013, 
                    purchasing well natured goods and services using cryptocurrencies 
                    like Bitcoin are not illegal. But those people or organization who 
                    mine Bitcoins and then trade them for a traditional currency or 
                    establish an exchange services on which BTC are bought and sold 
                    are then labelled as money transmitter and could subject to a 
                    special laws govern by that activity. </p>
                    <p>The legality of these cryptocurrencies, for instance Bitcoin is 
                    viewed differently by experts, but one thing that is sure, as long as 
                    it is not connected to any illicit activities, then you don’t have to 
                    worry about it. These cryptocurrencies do not exist on the list of 
                    sanctioned list currencies, its status could somewhat place a user 
                    at risk but no violation of any laws.</p>

                    <h5>Is Cyrptocurrency safe?</h5>
                    <p>Every day of each year cryptocurrency is getting known by people, 
                    of course it is made to exchange secure information, in the year 
                    2009 the first cryptocurrency was created in the name of Bitcoin. 
                    In the preceding years new cryptocurrencies follow namely, Dash, 
                    Ripple, Litecoin, etc. But among those list of cryptocurrencies in 
                    the marketplace, Bitcoin has not been beaten.</p>
                    <p>These cryptocurrencies are obviously safe and more and more 
                    people are trusting it, this is because of its decentralized feature, 
                    the transparency and how the system works.</p>
                    <p>Almost more than three million Bitcoin users are in the marketplace 
                    right now, most are doing investment in the said currency. Even 
                    though there are risk in investing this currency, because of its 
                    fluctuation, there are around more than 6,000 companies and 
                    organizations accepting Bitcoin payments.</p>
                    <p>One reasons why we should consider cryptocurrency safe is that 
                    wallet holder or buyer doesn’t need real information like credit card 
                    numbers etc. That alone ensures that you will not be known to 
                    someone. Years from now it is expected crypto currency like Bitcoin 
                    will become a bridge towards secure payments and will expand 
                    more.</p>
                    <h5>What are the benefit of cryptocurrency?</h5>
                    <p>Cryptocurrencies has many benefits. Basically, it is the best 
                    alternative for any transactions and even investment. In 
                    cryptocurreny you can even open an account by using fake data 
                    just to make sure and make sure that your personal data will not be 
                    embedded with your account during the deal.</p>
                    <p>Everything in cryptocurrency works in codes. Cryptocurrency like 
                    Monero, is more secure and 99.9 percent untraceable. And there 
                    are easy way to get cryptocurrency by dealing on exchanging 
                    platforms in the marketplace.</p>

                    <p>As what we keep saying, cryptocurrency is a decentralized 
                    payment system in which it allows its user to exchange even 
                    without the help of internet or the involvement of a financial 
                    institution. It has a superb authentication system and unique design 
                    to send payment at almost instant at the lowest cost anywhere in 
                    the world. Therefore, the answer the question is obviously yes! </p>
                    <p>Sending via cryptocurrency is simple yet fast, just log in on your 
                    wallet on the computer with internet connection and immediately 
                    send funds to someone that you want to send. Every account has 
                    no geographical borders and does not take country regulations, 
                    shall we say this is the easiest way to move your asset around the 
                    globe.</p>

                    low to around 0.30% fee.</p>
                    <h5>How cryptocurrency work?</h5>
                    <p>All cryptocurrencies are basically computer generated currencies. 
                    They exist by “mining” as its main function, its purpose is 
                    confirming record of movements and accounts known as 
                    blockchain. Coins as token are given to those miners who 
                    successfully completed a problem.</p>
                    <p>One’s a cryptocurrency is generated, they are stored in a 
                    completely secured wallet that is impossible of hacking. The coins 
                    can then be send to another wallet. Every transaction gets 
                    appended on the blockchain and verified by mining activity in the 
                    ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>Producing this coins are not unlimited, meaning they are limited 
                    and its generation velocity of the coin is variable. At first, it will be 
                    fast and in the long run it becomes slower. In case of BTC or 
                    Bitcoin, it is already known that the value of its coins is now record 
                    high, as network expands. More and more users compete a similar 
                    coins meaning coin price goes up.</p>

                    <h2>About Bangkok Crypto Club</h2>
                    <h5>What else are cryptocurrencies?</h5>
                    <p>There are lot of things to say about cryptocurrency, but they are 
                    usually divided into: <br />
                    Completely decentralized - “Decentralization” the most common 
                    words used in crypto-economics space, and often viewed as 
                    blockchain’s, No one controls it. <br />
                    Digital assets provided by something or someone – a user asset 
                    that is only to one. <br />
                    Dubious currencies are controlled and emitted by one company but 
                    not supported by the community.</p>
                    <h5>Is it worth creating your own cryptocurrency?</h5>
                    <p>While most of the cryptocurrencies in the marketplace re relatively 
                    new, the potential opportunities for potential player to join the 
                    making good money are still at stake. For crypt-followers, you have 
                    seen emerging new cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>
                    <p>But, these opportunities is believe to be just temporary and wont 
                    not last forever, though market matures, it will become harder for 
                    new player to enter the game and gets money from it.</p>
                    <h5>Why use cryptocurrency at all?</h5>
                    <p>Basically, a cryptocurrency exist because there are demands, 
                    what’s the use of it if people could not maximize its function? 
                    Now here the twist: don't think of existing needs but needs 
                    manufacture, or any needs that people haven’t realized it yet. Just 
                    imagine if you have a good chat to Justine Bieber and he agrees to 
                    sell his prelove items using the recently created newcoin. Now you 
                    have a change of monopoly and keen purchaser, so this time it’s 
                    hard to commit mistake.</p>
                    <p>Another situation, in which some big players charges magic fees, 
                    (credit card fees and currency transfer), or long processing of the 
                    transaction because of clearing. There are even organization that 
                    process currency transfer at a long period of time. Even though 
                    everything in the system is working fine. With the use of 
                    cryptocurrency all of those alibis, secret fees, delays, etc. will be 
                    forgotten.</p>
                    <h5>What is the main difference between tokens and cryptocurrencies?</h5>
                    <p>From what most people define, when we talk about currency, this is 
                    a generally accepted form of money, this can be paper notes, 
                    coins, which is naturally issued by the government and then 
                    circulated in the economy.</p>
